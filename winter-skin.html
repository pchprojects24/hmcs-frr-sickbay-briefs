      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>Cold air + ship heating = very dry air inside. This pulls water from your skin, lips, and nose.</p>
      <p>Simple items like a <strong>plain, fragrance-free moisturizing cream</strong>, <strong>lip balm</strong>, and <strong>saline nasal spray</strong> prevent most issues if you use them early and often.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> Moisturize twice daily, especially hands/face. Keep gloves dry and change socks often.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <h3>Day-to-day</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>warm, not hot</strong> water when you can.</li>
        <li>Use the gentlest soap available; alcohol hand rubs and harsh soaps dry skin fast.</li>
        <li><strong>After every wash or sanitizer use</strong>, rub in a small amount of <strong>plain, fragrance-free hand cream</strong> (cream or ointment works better than thin lotion). Keep a tube in your pocket.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>At night</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Put a <strong>thick layer</strong> of cream or petroleum jelly on dry areas and skin cracks.</li>
        <li>Wear thin cotton gloves or clean socks over hands overnight if available.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>On duty</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wear protective gloves for cleaning chemicals or frequent wet work.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><span class="icon">💋</span>Preventing Chapped Lips</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Carry a <strong>plain lip balm</strong> or petroleum jelly (avoid strong flavours/perfume if you're prone to irritation).</li>
        <li>Apply before watch, every 1–2 hours in wind/cold, and before sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't lick your lips</strong> – saliva evaporates and dries them more.</li>
        <li>If corners of the mouth crack, keep them clean and greasy with ointment; see medical if they are very sore or crusting.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep showers <strong>short and warm</strong>, not long and hot.</li>
        <li>Use soap mainly on armpits, groin, and feet. Rinse the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>After shower</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pat skin dry. While slightly damp, <strong>put a plain, fragrance-free cream</strong> on arms, legs, and hands (cream/ointment works better than lotion).</li>
        <li>Use petroleum jelly over cream for very dry spots at night (knuckles, shins, heels).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Out on deck</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cover skin: hat, neck gaiter, gloves; cover cheeks and nose in cold wind.</li>
        <li>If wool itches, wear cotton underneath to reduce rubbing.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Change out of <strong>wet or very damp socks</strong> as soon as you can.</li>
        <li><strong>Before bed:</strong> rub thick cream/ointment into heels and dry, cracked areas, then put on clean socks.</li>
        <li><strong>Days off:</strong> soak feet in warm water for 10 mins, gently file hard skin, then moisturize.</li>

        <li>Use anti-dandruff shampoo if you get flakes; leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
        <li><strong>Beards:</strong> Wash, rinse well, and use a light beard oil/conditioner to prevent drying and "beard dandruff."</li>
        <li>Wear a hat liner if wool hats make you itch.</li>
        <li>See medical if you have a red, very itchy rash or flaking that doesn't settle with over-the-counter shampoo.</li>

        <li>Apply a tiny amount of petroleum jelly just inside the nostrils at night with a clean finger or cotton bud tip (don't push deep into the nose).</li>
        <li><strong>For a bleed:</strong> Sit up, lean forward, pinch the soft part of your nose for 10–15 mins. Spit blood out; do not tilt head back.</li>
