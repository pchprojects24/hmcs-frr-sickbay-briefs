      <h2>Self-care for minor wounds</h2>
      <p>Small cuts, scrapes, and blisters can usually be handled yourself if bleeding stops with pressure, the wound is shallow, and edges close easily.</p>
      <p>Clean with water and mild soap, apply thin petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment, and cover with a clean dressing. Change daily or when wet. Avoid seawater exposure.</p>
      <p><strong>Get help now if:</strong> bleeding won't stop, wound is deep/gaping, it's a puncture or bite, you see spreading redness, or signs of infection appear.</p>

      <div class="content">
    <p>You can usually look after it yourself if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bleeding stops within a few minutes of firm pressure.</li>
      <li>The cut is small and shallow, edges close easily.</li>
      <li>It&rsquo;s a surface scrape or minor blister/chafing.</li>
      <li>It&rsquo;s a tiny skin split on a knuckle, fingertip, or heel.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-danger">
      <strong>Go to Sick Bay now if:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bleeding won&rsquo;t stop with 5–10 minutes of firm pressure.</li>
        <li>The wound is deep, gaping, or clearly needs stitches.</li>
        <li>It&rsquo;s a puncture (nail, fish spine, metal) or any bite.</li>
        <li>Something is stuck in the wound that you can&rsquo;t remove.</li>
        <li>The injury is near the eye, neck, genitals, or over a suspected fracture.</li>
      </ul>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">🚿</span>Clean the wound</summary>
      <div class="content">
    <p><strong>As soon as you can:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wash your hands with soap or sanitizer.</li>
      <li>Rinse the wound under a gentle stream of potable water for 2–5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Use mild soap on the skin around the wound; let water do most of the cleaning.</li>
      <li>Gently lift out any visible dirt with clean fingers or tweezers if you can see it easily.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Avoid pouring into the wound:</strong> hydrogen peroxide, full-strength iodine,
      alcohol, or strong detergents – they damage healing tissue.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t scrub raw tissue or pick at clots or scabs – this restarts bleeding and slows healing.</p>
    <p>If you still see grit or debris you can&rsquo;t remove with gentle rinsing, have Sick Bay check it.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">🧴</span>Antiseptics – only if really dirty</summary>
      <div class="content">
    <p>Most minor wounds don&rsquo;t need antiseptic solutions once they are well rinsed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the wound was heavily contaminated and still looks dirty, a one-time brief rinse
        with a <strong>dilute</strong> antiseptic (e.g. chlorhexidine 0.05% or povidone-iodine ~1%) is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Apply briefly, then rinse again with clean water.</li>
      <li>Avoid repeated soaking or scrubbing with antiseptics – this slows healing.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">💊</span>Ointment: petroleum jelly vs antibiotic</summary>
      <div class="content">
    <p>After cleaning, apply a <strong>thin</strong> layer over the wound:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plain petroleum jelly</strong> – good default for clean, low-risk minor wounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Antibiotic ointment</strong> (e.g. Polysporin&reg;) – consider for dirtier cuts,
        hand/foot wounds, or when infection would impact duty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stop using any antibiotic ointment if the surrounding skin becomes red and itchy
      (possible allergy); switch back to plain petroleum jelly.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">🩹</span>Dressings &amp; changing them</summary>
      <div class="content">
    <p>Covered, slightly moist wounds heal faster and hurt less.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a Band-Aid for small cuts, or a non-stick pad and tape for larger scrapes.</li>
      <li>Only use blister / hydrocolloid dressings on <strong>clean</strong> wounds (scrapes, blisters) under boots or gear.</li>
      <li>Change standard dressings at least daily, or sooner if wet or dirty.</li>
      <li>Hydrocolloid dressings can usually stay 2–5+ days if sealed, dry, and skin around looks normal –
        check once a day, especially at sea.</li>
      <li>Wrap snug, not tight – fingers and toes should stay warm and pink.</li>
    </ul>

      <summary><span class="icon">🌊</span>Seawater and "dirty" water</summary>
      <div class="content">
    <p>Salt water is not a disinfectant.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid exposing open wounds to seawater or dirty bilge/harbour water.</li>
      <li>If a wound does get soaked in seawater, rinse as soon as you can with potable water and mild soap,
        then re-dress with fresh ointment and a clean bandage.</li>
      <li>Keep wounds covered with a waterproof dressing if you expect spray or immersion.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-danger">
      <strong>After seawater exposure, get urgent help if:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain or swelling is rapidly worsening.</li>
        <li>Redness spreads quickly or skin turns purple/blue.</li>
        <li>Blisters/bullae appear near the wound.</li>
        <li>You develop fever, chills, or feel very unwell.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Routine tetanus booster: about every 10 years.</li>
      <li>Dirty or major wounds: a booster is usually recommended if it&rsquo;s been &gt;5 years.</li>
      <li>See Sick Bay if you don&rsquo;t know your last tetanus shot, never finished childhood vaccines,
        or have a dirty wound and last booster was &gt;5 years ago.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:var(--text-muted);margin-top:0.3rem;">
      Sick Bay can review your record, advise if a booster is needed, and give it if required.
