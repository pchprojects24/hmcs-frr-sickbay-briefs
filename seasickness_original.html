      <h2>What Seasickness Feels Like</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        Seasickness is your brain reacting to mixed signals: your inner ear feels motion, but your eyes and body position say you are still. The mismatch can make you feel nauseated, dizzy and unwell.
      </div>
      <p>Common symptoms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Queasy or “off” feeling in the stomach.</li>
        <li>Nausea and sometimes vomiting.</li>
        <li>Yawning, cold sweat, pale skin, heavy head.</li>
        <li>Dizziness, difficulty concentrating, feeling tired.</li>
        <li>Headache, increased salivation, loss of appetite.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Seasickness usually starts mild and builds. Catching it early and taking simple steps often prevents a bad day.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <span class="badge">Why it happens</span>
      <h2>Why Some People Feel Worse at Sea</h2>
      <p><strong>Sensory conflict:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your inner ear senses the ship’s pitch, roll and heave.</li>
        <li>If you are working below decks or staring at a close object, your eyes tell your brain you are still.</li>
        <li>The mismatch between “moving” and “not moving” triggers symptoms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Shipboard risk factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>New to sea or back after a long time ashore.</li>
        <li>Working below decks without a view of the horizon.</li>
        <li>Strong smells (fuel, galley, paint, heads) when already queasy.</li>
        <li>Reading, phone use or screens when the ship is moving a lot.</li>
        <li>Heavy, greasy meals, dehydration or a hangover before sailing.</li>
        <li>Not enough sleep, high stress, long days in rough weather.</li>
        <li>Known motion sensitivity in cars, aircraft or amusement rides.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is about physiology, not toughness. Many experienced sailors still get seasick in the wrong conditions.</p>

      <summary><span class="icon">🧭</span>What You Can Do Without Medication</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>1. Position and fresh air</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When safe to do so, move to a more stable part of the ship (midships, closer to waterline).</li>
        <li>Get into <strong>fresh, cool air</strong> and away from strong smells.</li>
        <li>Outside, look at the <strong>horizon or a fixed distant object</strong>, not the deck at your feet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What you look at and how you move</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid reading, phone use or fine close work once you feel queasy.</li>
        <li>Keep head movements slow and deliberate; avoid quick turns.</li>
        <li>On small boats, face the direction of travel where possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Food and fluids</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat <strong>small, bland meals</strong> (toast, crackers, plain cereal, simple sandwiches).</li>
        <li>Avoid very greasy, spicy or heavy meals before and during heavy seas.</li>
        <li>Do not sail on an empty stomach; a light snack is usually better than nothing.</li>
        <li>Take regular small sips of water or dilute drinks to stay hydrated.</li>
        <li>Avoid alcohol before and during sailing days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Rest and general condition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to be as well rested as possible before known rough transits.</li>
        <li>Fatigue and stress make seasickness harder to tolerate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Simple physical strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If off duty and unwell, lie on your back in a stable area with your head supported and minimal movement.</li>
        <li>Loosen tight clothing; avoid overheating.</li>
        <li>Use slow, steady breathing: in through the nose, out through the mouth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Low-risk extras (mixed evidence)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ginger</strong> (biscuits, tea, tablets) may help mild nausea for some people.</li>
        <li><strong>Acupressure wrist bands</strong> (P6 point) are low risk; some find them helpful.</li>
        <li>Chewing gum or mints may provide distraction and help with saliva flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These extras are optional. The basics (position, air, vision, food and fluids) make the biggest difference.</p>

      <span class="badge">Medication overview</span>
      <h2>Gravol &amp; Similar Medications: Where They Fit</h2>
      <p>This section is about how these medicines affect you and your duties. It is not a dosing guide.</p>

      <h3>1. Dimenhydrinate (Gravol&reg;)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>First-generation antihistamine commonly used for motion sickness.</li>
        <li>Available in Sick Bay for crew use; also available over-the-counter.</li>
        <li><strong>Main side-effect:</strong> drowsiness and slower reaction time. Some people feel very sleepy or “foggy”.</li>
        <li>Can also cause dry mouth, blurred vision and, less often, constipation or urinary difficulty.</li>
        <li>Alcohol and other sedating medicines make this worse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Meclizine (e.g., Bonamine&reg;)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Another motion-sickness antihistamine that is often less sedating for many people.</li>
        <li>Can be obtained through the Base Clinic or purchased where available.</li>
        <li>Still may cause some drowsiness, but often milder than dimenhydrinate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. General safety points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>These medicines can help you tolerate motion, but they can also <strong>impair watchkeeping, machinery operation and weapon handling</strong>.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible, <strong>try a new motion-sickness medicine on a non-critical day</strong> first, so you know how sleepy it makes you.</li>
        <li>Follow Sick Bay advice and package instructions. Do not take more than recommended or mix multiple products without medical guidance.</li>
        <li>Tell your supervisor if you have taken a sedating medication and you are assigned to safety-critical duties.</li>
        <li>If you are pregnant, have eye, heart, prostate or serious medical issues, discuss use with Sick Bay before relying on these medicines.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you think you need regular or strong medication just to function at sea, discuss this with the MO or Sick Bay rather than self-managing long-term.</p>

      <summary><span class="icon">📋</span>Step-by-Step: What to Do When You Feel Seasick</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>1. Before sailing / early prep</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get a reasonable sleep if you can.</li>
        <li>Eat a light, non-greasy meal before sailing.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated; avoid alcohol.</li>
        <li>If you are known to be very motion-sensitive, sort out your plan early (preferred position, non-drug measures, and any approved medication) with Sick Bay or your supervisor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. At the first signs of queasiness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Move to fresh air and, if safe, a place where you can see the horizon.</li>
        <li>Stop reading or using your phone.</li>
        <li>Use slow breathing and try to keep your head movements smooth.</li>
        <li>Have small sips of water or a simple drink; nibble bland snacks if you can tolerate them.</li>
        <li>Use low-risk extras such as ginger or a wrist band if you choose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. If symptoms continue but are still manageable</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep up the non-drug measures above; sometimes it takes a bit of time to settle.</li>
        <li>If you have been <strong>cleared to use motion-sickness medicine</strong> (Gravol, meclizine) and you are not in a heavily safety-critical role, you may choose to take it as directed.</li>
        <li>Be honest with yourself about how drowsy you feel. If you are too sleepy for safe duties, you must speak to your supervisor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. If you are vomiting or unable to function</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Let your supervisor know; do not quietly stay at a safety-critical station while severely unwell.</li>
        <li>Move away from tasks where an error could harm you or others.</li>
        <li>Go to Sick Bay for assessment, hydration and supervised treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="badge">Red flags</span>
      <h2>When Seasickness Might Be Something Else</h2>
      <p>Seasickness is common, but not everything that happens at sea is “just” seasickness.</p>

      <h3>See Sick Bay promptly if:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You are vomiting repeatedly or cannot keep fluids down.</li>
        <li>Dizziness is so severe that you cannot stand, walk or perform duties safely.</li>
        <li>Seasickness-like symptoms are still severe after 1–3 days at sea and are affecting your ability to do your job.</li>
        <li>You need motion-sickness tablets most days just to cope at sea.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Get urgent help (do not assume seasickness) if:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You have chest pain, shortness of breath, or feel like you might collapse.</li>
        <li>You have a severe, sudden headache, confusion, or trouble speaking.</li>
        <li>You notice one-sided weakness, facial droop, slurred speech or difficulty walking straight.</li>
        <li>You have high fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting blood/black material.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout-danger">
        If something feels “not right” or out of proportion to usual seasickness, get checked. It is better to be seen and reassured than to miss a serious problem.

      <span class="badge">Key points</span>
      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Seasickness is common and often improves after a few days, but it can seriously affect safety and performance.</li>
        <li>Start with non-drug steps: position, fresh air, horizon view, small bland meals, fluids and rest.</li>
        <li>Gravol and meclizine can help but may make you sleepy and slower; use them within unit policy and be honest about your fitness for duty.</li>
        <li>See Sick Bay if you cannot keep fluids down, if symptoms stay severe, or if anything does not fit the usual seasickness pattern.</li>
