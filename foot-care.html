      <h2>Common foot problems in boots</h2>
      <p>Dry socks, dry boots, and a 30-second check of your feet every day will prevent most problems. Don't ignore deep cracks, spreading redness or pain that makes it hard to stand watch — those need Sick Bay.</p>
      <p>Long days in damp socks and boots can lead to <strong>maceration ("soggy feet")</strong>, <strong>athlete's foot</strong>, <strong>blisters</strong>, <strong>calluses</strong>, <strong>"trench-foot-like" problems</strong>, and <strong>secondary infections</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> Fresh socks daily, wash and dry feet (especially between toes), air boots after watch, and see Sick Bay if redness spreads or pain interferes with duty.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh socks every day — and change again mid-day on long watches.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry your feet daily, especially between the toes.</li>
        <li>Wear shower sandals in communal heads/showers.</li>
        <li>Air boots and remove insoles after watch so they fully dry.</li>
        <li>Use foot powder <em>before</em> problems start, not just after.</li>
        <li>Pad &amp; tape hot spots before they become blisters.</li>
        <li>See Sick Bay if athlete's foot doesn't improve, or if there is spreading redness, pain or pus.</li>

      <summary><span class="icon">❓</span>Why feet break down in damp boots</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <p>Feet inside boots are warm, dark and often wet with sweat. That combination causes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soft, fragile skin:</strong> when skin stays wet, it turns white and wrinkled and tears more easily (maceration).</li>
        <li><strong>Fungal overgrowth:</strong> fungus that causes athlete's foot thrives in warm, moist toe webs and damp socks.</li>
        <li><strong>More blisters:</strong> wet skin rubs and shears more, so you blister faster in damp socks.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold-wet injury:</strong> in cold conditions, wet feet lose heat quickly and blood flow drops, which can damage tissues ("trench-foot-like" problems).</li>
        <li><strong>Entry points for infection:</strong> cracked heels, split toe webs and popped blisters give bacteria a way in.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">🛡️</span>Daily prevention: socks, boots &amp; hygiene</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>1. Socks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>wool-blend or moisture-wicking socks</strong>; avoid 100% cotton that holds sweat.</li>
        <li><strong>New pair every day</strong> without fail. On a long duty day, change socks once in the middle as well.</li>
        <li>Always put on <strong>clean, dry</strong> socks after a shower — not yesterday's pair.</li>
        <li>Avoid socks that are so tight they leave deep marks (reduced circulation) or so loose they bunch up and rub.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Boots</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have two pairs, <strong>rotate boots</strong> so each pair can dry fully between uses.</li>
        <li>After watch, <strong>open laces</strong>, remove insoles and air boots in a dry, ventilated spot.</li>
        <li>Don't sleep in boots or wet socks. Give feet an off-duty "airing out" every night.</li>
        <li>Make sure boots fit properly: not crushing toes, not so loose your heel lifts and rubs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Foot hygiene</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wash feet daily</strong> with soap, including between toes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry thoroughly</strong> — towel between each toe before socks go on.</li>
        <li>Wear <strong>shower sandals</strong> in communal showers and heads.</li>
        <li>Keep toenails trimmed straight across; don't share towels or footwear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Moisture control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use foot powder <strong>before</strong> a long watch:
          <ul>
            <li>Plain drying powder for sweaty feet.</li>
            <li>Antifungal powder (e.g., tolnaftate, miconazole) if you tend to athlete's foot.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Apply a light dusting to dry feet and inside socks/boots; avoid thick clumps.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible on breaks, <strong>take boots and socks off</strong> for 5–10 minutes of air time.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="icon">🦶</span>Early athlete's foot: what you can do yourself</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Typical signs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Itchy, burning skin between toes.</li>
        <li>Peeling or scaly patches, sometimes white and soggy in the toe webs.</li>
        <li>Dry, flaky skin on the soles that doesn't just look like "normal dry skin."</li>
        <li>Sometimes blisters or a strong foot odour.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Over-the-counter antifungals (ingredients)</h3>
      <p>At a pharmacy (or provided by Sick Bay), look for creams or sprays containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clotrimazole 1%</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Miconazole 2%</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Terbinafine 1%</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These all work similarly when used correctly.</p>

      <h3>How to use them</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>After showering, <strong>dry your feet well</strong>, especially between the toes.</li>
        <li>Apply a <strong>thin layer</strong> of cream to the rash and 1–2&nbsp;cm beyond the edges.</li>
        <li>Use once or twice daily as per product instructions.</li>
        <li>Continue treatment <strong>for 1–2&nbsp;weeks after the rash clears</strong> to fully kill the fungus.</li>
        <li>At the same time, tighten up hygiene: fresh socks, powder, shower sandals, and cleaning the shower floor where possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> cream alone won't work if your feet stay wet in the same socks all day.
        The combination of <em>medicine + dry feet + clean socks/boots</em> is what cures it.
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Sick Bay note:</strong> Athlete's foot is
        a valid reason to see Sick Bay. Clotrimazole cream is
        available and can be issued with clear instructions if you're not improving with your own measures.

      <summary><span class="icon">🩹</span>Blisters and maceration ("soggy feet")</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <h3>Blisters – quick rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small, not too painful:</strong> leave it intact. Pad around it (moleskin donut, blister plaster) and protect inside your sock.</li>
        <li><strong>Large or very painful:</strong> you can carefully drain it:
          <ul>
            <li>Clean skin; use a clean/sterilized needle to pierce near the edge.</li>
            <li>Gently press out fluid; keep the "roof" skin in place.</li>
            <li>Apply a small amount of ointment and cover with a non-stick dressing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> tear off the overlying skin; it's your natural bandage.</li>
        <li>Watch for infection: increasing redness, pus, warmth or red streaks — those need Sick Bay.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Maceration ("soggy white" feet)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove wet socks/boots and <strong>gently dry</strong> feet as soon as you can.</li>
        <li>Air feet in a warm, dry space. Don't rub hard; the wet skin is fragile.</li>
        <li>Once mostly dry, you may:
          <ul>
            <li>Use a little barrier ointment (e.g., petroleum jelly) on heels/soles if they crack easily.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>powder, not ointment</strong>, between toes to keep that area dry.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If skin peels, trim only loose dead skin; don't pull at it and don't leave raw areas unprotected.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        If maceration is severe (very painful, swollen, or you've lost sensation) or keeps coming back even after
        better habits, speak with Sick Bay. It may be early immersion foot or need stronger measures.

      <summary><span class="icon">⚠️</span>When to see Sick Bay</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Athlete's foot <strong>isn't improving</strong> after 2–4&nbsp;weeks of proper cream + hygiene.</li>
        <li>You have painful heel or toe cracks that make it hard to walk or wear boots.</li>
        <li>There is <strong>spreading redness, warmth, swelling or pus</strong> around any broken skin.</li>
        <li>You notice <strong>red streaks</strong> going up your foot or leg, or you feel feverish/unwell.</li>
        <li>You have a very large or deep blister in a weight-bearing area that you can't protect on your own.</li>
        <li>Your feet are <strong>persistently numb, pale/blue, or very painful</strong> after cold-wet exposure.</li>
        <li>Foot problems are interfering with your ability to safely stand watch, climb ladders or wear required footwear.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning-card">
        <h2>⚠️ Get urgent help</h2>
        <p>Don't wait for routine Sick Parade if redness and swelling are spreading quickly, you have severe pain or fever, or the foot looks dusky/purple/black.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem;margin-top:0.75rem;">Medical staff can provide stronger antifungals or antibiotics when needed, assess for immersion foot, and arrange modified duties or different footwear until your feet recover. Early visits mean easier fixes.</p>
