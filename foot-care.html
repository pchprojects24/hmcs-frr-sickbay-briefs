      <h2>Common foot problems in boots</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
        Dry socks, dry boots, and a 30-second check of your feet every day will prevent most problems. Don't ignore deep cracks, spreading redness or pain that makes it hard to stand watch — those need Sick Bay.
      </div>
      <p>Long days in damp socks and boots can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Maceration (&ldquo;soggy feet&rdquo;)</strong> &mdash; pale, soft, wrinkled skin that tears and cracks easily.</li>
          <li><strong>Athlete&rsquo;s foot (tinea pedis)</strong> &mdash; itchy, burning, peeling skin, especially between the toes.</li>
          <li><strong>Blisters and hot spots</strong> &mdash; friction bubbles on heels, toes and balls of the feet.</li>
          <li><strong>Calluses and corns</strong> &mdash; thick, hard skin or small hard bumps from ongoing rubbing or tight boots.</li>
          <li><strong>&ldquo;Trench-foot-like&rdquo; problems</strong> &mdash; cold + wet exposure causing numb, painful, swollen feet.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary infections</strong> &mdash; redness, swelling or pus when germs enter through cracked skin.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Not covered here:</strong> major trauma, fractures, severe diabetic foot problems or deep
          ulcers. Those are emergencies &mdash; go straight to Sick Bay.

        <span class="badge">At a glance</span>
        <h2>Quick habits that make the biggest difference</h2>
        <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Fresh socks every day &mdash; and change again mid-day on long watches.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry your feet daily, especially between the toes.</li>
        <li>Wear shower sandals in communal heads/showers.</li>
        <li>Air boots and remove insoles after watch so they fully dry.</li>
        <li>Use foot powder <em>before</em> problems start, not just after.</li>
        <li>Pad &amp; tape hot spots before they become blisters.</li>
        <li>See Sick Bay if athlete&rsquo;s foot doesn&rsquo;t improve, or if there is spreading redness, pain or pus.</li>

    <section class="card">
      <span class="badge">Why it happens</span>
      <h2>Why feet break down in damp boots</h2>
      <p>Feet inside boots are warm, dark and often wet with sweat. That combination causes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soft, fragile skin:</strong> when skin stays wet, it turns white and wrinkled and
          tears more easily (maceration).</li>
        <li><strong>Fungal overgrowth:</strong> fungus that causes athlete&rsquo;s foot thrives in warm,
          moist toe webs and damp socks.</li>
        <li><strong>More blisters:</strong> wet skin rubs and shears more, so you blister faster in damp socks.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold-wet injury:</strong> in cold conditions, wet feet lose heat quickly and blood
          flow drops, which can damage tissues (&ldquo;trench-foot-like&rdquo; problems).</li>
        <li><strong>Entry points for infection:</strong> cracked heels, split toe webs and popped blisters
          give bacteria a way in.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <span class="badge">Prevention</span>
      <h2>Daily prevention: socks, boots &amp; hygiene</h2>

      <h3>1. Socks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>wool-blend or moisture-wicking socks</strong>; avoid 100% cotton that holds sweat.</li>
        <li><strong>New pair every day</strong> without fail. On a long duty day, change socks once in the middle as well.</li>
        <li>Always put on <strong>clean, dry</strong> socks after a shower &mdash; not yesterday&rsquo;s pair.</li>
        <li>Avoid socks that are so tight they leave deep marks (reduced circulation) or so loose they bunch up and rub.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Boots</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have two pairs, <strong>rotate boots</strong> so each pair can dry fully between uses.</li>
        <li>After watch, <strong>open laces</strong>, remove insoles and air boots in a dry, ventilated spot.</li>
        <li>Don&rsquo;t sleep in boots or wet socks. Give feet an off-duty &ldquo;airing out&rdquo; every night.</li>
        <li>Make sure boots fit properly: not crushing toes, not so loose your heel lifts and rubs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Foot hygiene</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wash feet daily</strong> with soap, including between toes.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry thoroughly</strong> &mdash; towel between each toe before socks go on.</li>
        <li>Wear <strong>shower sandals</strong> in communal showers and heads.</li>
        <li>Keep toenails trimmed straight across; don&rsquo;t share towels or footwear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Moisture control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use foot powder <strong>before</strong> a long watch:
          <ul>
            <li>Plain drying powder for sweaty feet.</li>
            <li>Antifungal powder (e.g., tolnaftate, miconazole) if you tend to athlete&rsquo;s foot.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Apply a light dusting to dry feet and inside socks/boots; avoid thick clumps.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible on breaks, <strong>take boots and socks off</strong> for 5–10 minutes of air time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <span class="badge">Self-care</span>
      <h2>Early athlete&rsquo;s foot: what you can do yourself</h2>
      <p><strong>Typical signs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Itchy, burning skin between toes.</li>
        <li>Peeling or scaly patches, sometimes white and soggy in the toe webs.</li>
        <li>Dry, flaky skin on the soles that doesn&rsquo;t just look like &ldquo;normal dry skin.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Sometimes blisters or a strong foot odour.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Over-the-counter antifungals (ingredients)</h3>
      <p>At a pharmacy (or provided by Sick Bay), look for creams or sprays containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clotrimazole 1%</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Miconazole 2%</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Terbinafine 1%</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These all work similarly when used correctly.</p>

      <h3>How to use them</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>After showering, <strong>dry your feet well</strong>, especially between the toes.</li>
        <li>Apply a <strong>thin layer</strong> of cream to the rash and 1–2&nbsp;cm beyond the edges.</li>
        <li>Use once or twice daily as per product instructions.</li>
        <li>Continue treatment <strong>for 1–2&nbsp;weeks after the rash clears</strong> to fully kill the fungus.</li>
        <li>At the same time, tighten up hygiene: fresh socks, powder, shower sandals, and cleaning the shower floor where possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> cream alone won&rsquo;t work if your feet stay wet in the same socks all day.
        The combination of <em>medicine + dry feet + clean socks/boots</em> is what cures it.
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Sick Bay note:</strong> Athlete&rsquo;s foot is
        a valid reason to see Sick Bay. Clotrimazole cream is
        available and can be issued with clear instructions if you&rsquo;re not improving with your own measures.

      <span class="badge">Blisters &amp; soggy feet</span>
      <h2>Blisters and maceration (&ldquo;soggy feet&rdquo;)</h2>

      <h3>Blisters – quick rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small, not too painful:</strong> leave it intact. Pad around it (moleskin donut, blister plaster) and protect inside your sock.</li>
        <li><strong>Large or very painful:</strong> you can carefully drain it:
          <ul>
            <li>Clean skin; use a clean/sterilized needle to pierce near the edge.</li>
            <li>Gently press out fluid; keep the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; skin in place.</li>
            <li>Apply a small amount of ointment and cover with a non-stick dressing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> tear off the overlying skin; it&rsquo;s your natural bandage.</li>
        <li>Watch for infection: increasing redness, pus, warmth or red streaks &mdash; those need Sick Bay.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Maceration (&ldquo;soggy white&rdquo; feet)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove wet socks/boots and <strong>gently dry</strong> feet as soon as you can.</li>
        <li>Air feet in a warm, dry space. Don&rsquo;t rub hard; the wet skin is fragile.</li>
        <li>Once mostly dry, you may:
          <ul>
            <li>Use a little barrier ointment (e.g., petroleum jelly) on heels/soles if they crack easily.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>powder, not ointment</strong>, between toes to keep that area dry.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If skin peels, trim only loose dead skin; don&rsquo;t pull at it and don&rsquo;t leave raw areas unprotected.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        If maceration is severe (very painful, swollen, or you&rsquo;ve lost sensation) or keeps coming back even after
        better habits, speak with Sick Bay. It may be early immersion foot or need stronger measures.

      <span class="badge">When to see Sick Bay</span>
      <h2>Red flags – don&rsquo;t self-manage these</h2>
      <h3>See Sick Bay promptly if:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Athlete&rsquo;s foot <strong>isn&rsquo;t improving</strong> after 2–4&nbsp;weeks of proper cream + hygiene.</li>
        <li>You have painful heel or toe cracks that make it hard to walk or wear boots.</li>
        <li>There is <strong>spreading redness, warmth, swelling or pus</strong> around any broken skin.</li>
        <li>You notice <strong>red streaks</strong> going up your foot or leg, or you feel feverish/unwell.</li>
        <li>You have a very large or deep blister in a weight-bearing area that you can&rsquo;t protect on your own.</li>
        <li>Your feet are <strong>persistently numb, pale/blue, or very painful</strong> after cold-wet exposure.</li>
        <li>Foot problems are interfering with your ability to safely stand watch, climb ladders or wear required footwear.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout-danger">
        <strong>Get urgent help</strong> (don&rsquo;t wait for routine Sick Parade) if:
        <ul>
          <li>Redness and swelling are spreading quickly.</li>
          <li>You have severe pain, fever, or feel very unwell.</li>
          <li>The foot looks dusky, purple or black, or you&rsquo;re losing sensation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="footer-note">
        Medical staff can provide stronger antifungals or antibiotics when needed, assess for immersion foot,
        and arrange modified duties or different footwear until your feet recover. Early visits mean easier fixes.
