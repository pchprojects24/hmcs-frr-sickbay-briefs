      <h2>What's going on with my skin?</h2>
      <p>All three problems — razor burn, bumps, and folliculitis — can overlap. The aim here is to calm the skin, reduce bumps, and keep you able to shave safely for work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Razor burn (irritation):</strong> Red, burning or stinging skin right after shaving. From friction, dry shaving, dull blades, or pressing too hard.</li>
        <li><strong>Razor bumps (ingrown hairs):</strong> Small firm bumps, often with a hair trapped inside, usually on the neck or jawline. More common with curly or coarse hair and very close shaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Folliculitis (infected follicles):</strong> Bacteria get into irritated hair follicles. Small sore pimples with white/yellow heads that can crust.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Fast changes that usually help quickly.</p>
      
      <h3>✅ DO</h3>

      <summary><span class="icon">🪒</span>Routine for Better Shaving</summary>
      <div class="content">
      
      <h3>Step 1 – Before you shave</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm up:</strong> shave after a warm shower or hold a warm, wet cloth on the area for 2–3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean the skin:</strong> wash with a mild, non-scrubby face wash.</li>
        <li><strong>Lather up:</strong> apply shaving cream/gel and let it sit for about a minute to soften hairs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2 – During the shave</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direction:</strong> shave with the grain. Check which way hair grows in each area.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> use light pressure and short strokes; let the blade do the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Passes:</strong> try to shave each area once. If you must go again, rinse and re-lather first.</li>
        <li><strong>Aim:</strong> aim for "inspection clean," not glass-smooth. Leaving ~1 mm of stubble usually causes fewer ingrowns (follow unit shaving standards or medical profile).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3 – After the shave</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rinse and cool:</strong> rinse with cool water, then gently pat dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> apply a gentle, alcohol-free moisturizer or balm.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands off:</strong> avoid scratching, rubbing, or picking bumps.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><span class="icon">🔧</span>Choosing the Right Tools</summary>
      <div class="content">
      
      <h3>Multi-blade cartridges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> fast, very close shave.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> more friction and "lift and cut" can cause more ingrown hairs, especially on curly hair.</li>
        <li><em>Tip:</em> use very light pressure and don't chase an ultra-close shave if you get bumps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Single-blade (safety) razors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> cuts hairs at skin level; often better for bump-prone skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> needs a bit of practice to use safely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Electric shavers / clippers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> usually leave a tiny amount of stubble, which reduces ingrown hairs; quick.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> not baby-smooth; needs power and regular cleaning.</li>
        <li><em>Note:</em> any stubble length must still meet grooming/respirator standards for your role.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chemical depilatory creams</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> no blade; hair regrows with a blunt end.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> can irritate or burn skin and often smell strong; must follow package directions exactly and patch-test first.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><span class="icon">🧴</span>What to Keep in Your Wash Bag</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <p>Useful items for your wash bag (ingredient-based, not brand-specific):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gentle face wash:</strong> mild, non-scrub cleanser for daily use.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaving lubricant:</strong> shaving cream/gel for sensitive skin (avoid strong fragrance if you react easily).</li>
        <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> simple alcohol-free moisturizer or aftershave balm.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optional extras (over-the-counter)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mild chemical exfoliant:</strong> product with a low strength of salicylic acid or similar, used a few times per week to help prevent trapped hairs. Stop if it burns or peels too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Benzoyl peroxide wash:</strong> a low-strength wash once daily if you get pimple-like folliculitis; rinse off well and be aware it can bleach fabric.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrocortisone cream (0.5–1%):</strong> for short-term use (a few days) on bad razor burn to reduce redness and itch. Not for daily, long-term use.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Start new products slowly and one at a time so you know what your skin tolerates.</em></p>

      <summary><span class="icon">⚠️</span>When to see medical</summary>
      <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Bumps are <strong>very painful</strong>, keep getting infected, or you see <strong>pus, crusting, or spreading redness</strong>.</li>
        <li>You have many deep, hard bumps or scars on the neck or jawline.</li>
        <li>Rash is blistering, oozing, or keeping you awake at night.</li>
        <li>Skin problems make it hard to shave to required standards, wear PPE, or do your job safely.</li>
        <li>You've tried good shaving technique and basic self-care for a few weeks and things are <strong>not improving</strong> or are getting worse.</li>
        <li>You're unsure if it's shaving rash, infection, eczema, or something else.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem;margin-top:0.75rem;">Medical staff can check for infection or other skin conditions and talk through options such as different shaving methods, medicated creams, or (if needed) shaving profiles in line with policy.</p>
